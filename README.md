## Description
**Gastric cancer** is the leading type of cancer in Korea. This dataset has been collected from the Kangbuk Samsung Medical Hospital (KSMH), Seoul, South Korea. The 96 WSI has been collected form the **96** patients from 2018-2020. The digitized images were taken at **40x** magnification using an **Aperio digital slide scanner (Leica Biosystems)**. The size of a WSI is ∼100,000 x ∼80,000 with **0.2635 μm x 0.2635** μm pixel spacing. Each WSI was examined by experienced pathologists Kyungeun Kim
,Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine and Boram Song, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine to identify distinct tissue regions, including BN, tubular well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (TW), tubular well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (TM), and tubular poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma (TP).There are some types of cancer  Using these tissue regions, we generated image patches of size 1024 x 1024 pixels that are split into training, validation, and test data. Sample Images are shown below.
